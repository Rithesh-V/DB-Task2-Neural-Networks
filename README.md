# DB-Task2-Neural-Networks
Task problem stmnt:
This task is to design a neural network with forward and back propagation while separating the two inputs out of n inputs and carry out computation separately for the first propagtion alone.


Things to specify:
1. I have taken number of inputs to be 10 each of size 100.
2. dataset is a randomnly generated array of numbers.
3. 5 hidden layers are utilized
4. output is displayed as epoch number and loss.
